In New Zealand many retail companies offer wonderful products and allow their customers to pay for it weekly or fortnightly. So you can imagine they have thousands of customers and contracts need to handle and how to effectively manage their accounts is a big challenge for them. Therefore my system was born and it perfectly solved those problems. The system enable retailers to trace customers' payment plans and notice them to delivery or repossess their products. The system mainly include three part named customer maintenance, contract management and bank statement management. The contract management is key of the system and others are around it because it associate with other parts like customer, statement, products, repossession, delivery and so on. Finally, my customer (company website: www.goodvalue.co.nz) has already used this system for a while and they are happy and satisfied in this practical and powerful system. ">

                            My position is a backend developer. But I also did some frontend works. My main responsibilities were to design database structure and then coded to build new functions using c# language basing on .net Framework 4.5 version. We use 2008R,2012 SQL database and VS2010,VS2012 develop tools.
                            Currently, we have three websites named BargainHunting, buz and netsky. The BargainHunting is online business website, which there were four people involved long time ago and finally I organized their code together and meanwhile added extra functions. The buz is a social network website. My manager he designed the pages and functions on the papers and I designed the database structure and coded to made his ideas come true. The netSky project is a kind of application integration platform including online trade, social network, travel, sharing files system and etc. Our idea was to build a flexible and powerful platform so that we would be able to easily extend new features on this platform. My job was to try to simulate asp.net application to Silverlight and created new features. So far we haven’t finished them yet. But if you visited it - http://sky.ishoppersnz.com/netsky.aspx, you would be able to figure out our ambitions.
                            So the netSky is a Silverlight application and the BargainHunting and buz are asp.net website applications.
